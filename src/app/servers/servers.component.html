  <!--Two way binding
  Important: For Two-Way-Binding to work, you need to enable the ngModel  directive.
  This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule (app.module.ts).
  You then also need to add the import from @angular/forms  in the app.module.ts file:
  import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
-->
  <input
    type="text"
    class="form-control"
    [(ngModel)] = "serverName"/>

  <!--<p>{{ serverName}} </p> -->

<button class="btn btn-primary"
  [disabled]="!allowNewServer"
  (click)="onCreateServer()" >Add Server </button>
  <p *ngIf="serverCreated"> Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }} </p>
  <!--
  if-else
  <p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer"> Server was created, server name is {{ serverName }} </p>
  <ng-template #noServer>
    <p>No server was created! </p>
  </ng-template>

<!--<p>{{ serverCreationStatus }}</p>-->
<!--NgFor is a directive that iterates over collection of data. It is used to customize data display.
